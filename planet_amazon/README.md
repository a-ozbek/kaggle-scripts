My work for the Planet - Amazon kaggle competition.

* 40k total images. 32k/8k train/validation split.
* Finetuning Inception V3 CNN architecture in Keras framework
* This solution ranked top 26% in the competition.

Bagging with 5-fold split could have increased the score significantly, but unfortunately training times take too long.
